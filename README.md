The Green Defender is a robot that is plugged into the soil. It then detects the temperature, humidity and water level of the soil; these readings are all displayed on a screen at the top. Temperature and humidity are displayed numerically and based on the water level, the display indicates whether the plants should be watered or not. Additionally, the Green Defender has a super sonic sensor that can detect anything within a preset distance away from the robot (preferably within 3 meters). Once anything moving (such as an animal pursuing the plant or crop) is detected by the sensor, a buzzer on the robot is triggered and played for 20 seconds, scaring away any potential threat to the plant/crop.

The Green Defender was built using an Arduino UNO board, a bread board, jumper wires, a temperature/humidity sensor, a display screen, a water sensor, an ultra sonic sensor, a passive buzzer module, and popsicle sticks. The sensors and modules were connected directly to the breadboard, and the breadboard was connected to the Arduino. The popsicle sticks were used to make a funnel for the sensors, so that they can be placed into the soil easier (without the wires getting tangled).
